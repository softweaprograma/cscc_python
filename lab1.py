# We are baking brownies!  We have a recipe which calls for the following ingredients:
# 0.5 cups butter
# 2 eggs
# 1 teaspoon vanilla
# 1 cup sugar
# 0.5 cups flour
# 0.5 cups cocoa powder
# 0.25 teaspoons baking powder
# 0.25 teaspoons salt
# The ingredients in this recipe will make 9 brownies.
# Write a program which asks the user how many brownies they wish to bake,
# then displays the adjusted recipe with the correct amounts for making that number of brownies.
# Don't worry about converting teaspoons to cups (etc) - just display the amounts in their original measurements.
